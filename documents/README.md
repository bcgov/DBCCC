# DriveBC Code Challenge - OXD

This directory contains supporting documentation created for the DriveBC Code Challenge.

## Wireframes

To guide development, we created first created a [sketch](./sketch/DriveBC-Large%20screen-map%20navigation%20sketch.pdf) and then a A set of [Axure wireframes](./wireframe-prototype/start.html) based on the user stories and requirements provided in the Challenge instructions.

*Note:* To view these wireframes, your browser will need the [Axure extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dogkpdfcklifaemcdfbildhcofnopogp). Instructions are provided when you first open the link.

## Definition of Done

This [document](./Definition_Of_Done_Checklists_Open_Entries.pdf) has examples of how the team would track the Definition of Done's tasks. For this code challenge, we have a separate checklist for user stories and another one for the entire release.

An outline of our typical [testing strategy](./Testing%20Strategy%20Outline%20-%20DriveBC%20Code%20Challenge.pdf) for development of this type of app, with details of how it was modified for the time limitations of this code challenge.
